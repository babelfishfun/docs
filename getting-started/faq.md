# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Babelfish, $BABEL tokens, and how to get started as a Babelonian.

## General Questions

### What is Babelfish?
Babelfish is a Web3 communication platform that enables universal translation across languages and cultures. Inspired by the Babel fish from *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, we use AI-powered translation to dissolve language barriers and connect people worldwide.

### How does the translation work?
Babelfish uses the xAI Grok API for real-time translation of text, audio, and video. Our AI understands cultural context and nuances, not just words, providing accurate and culturally appropriate translations across 100+ languages.

### Is Babelfish free to use?
Yes! Basic features are completely free, including:
- Universal translation for text, audio, and video
- Community participation (up to 200 members)
- Basic messaging and calls
- $BABEL token earning through invitations

Premium features require $BABEL token staking or subscription plans.

### What makes Babelfish different from other translation apps?
- **Real-time AI translation** with cultural context understanding
- **Web3 integration** with $BABEL token governance and rewards
- **Flexible identity system** supporting social media, email, and Web3 wallets
- **Community-focused** with Telegram-like features and social media expansion

During registration, you'll select your primary language from 100+ options. You can change this anytime in your settings, and you can add multiple languages for enhanced translation.
